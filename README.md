# Benchmark Suite

Project dedicated to create benchmark datasets to test applications that adopt serendipity by analogy using Linked Data datasets as datasource. 

Therefore, the Benchmark Suite project defines a workflow and implements the necessary steps for building a benchmark dataset: data mapping, data retrieval and data manipulation.

The current implementation is used for building a benchmark dataset for the movies domain.
